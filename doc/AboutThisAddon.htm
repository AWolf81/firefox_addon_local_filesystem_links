<strong>Summary</strong>
This Firefox extension scans pages for file:/// links and makes it possible to open them with the Windows Explorer (Windows only).

<strong>Target Audience</strong>
The extensions was created to assist people using local or enterprise intranet sites (e. g. Wikis)
where pages exist that link to files that are located on the local drive or on network shares.

<strong>Details</strong>

Currently there are two methods of opening local file system links.

<i>1) Automatic file link recognition</i>
An automatic file link recognition scans for hyperlinks with a file:/// prefix.
For each of these hyperlinks a folder icon will be inserted on the right side of the hyperlink.
If you click the icon the local file link is opened in Windows Explorer.

<i>2) Page context menu entry</i>
The extension adds an entry 'Open with Windows Explorer' to the page context menu that works on selected text.
